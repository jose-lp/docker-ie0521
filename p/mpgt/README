bottom_left_point_y: Bottom left y coordinate corner point for filtering
bottom_right_point_x: Bottom right x coordinate corner point for filtering
bottom_right_point_y: Bottom right y coordinate corner point for filtering

history: Length of the history for MOG

bShadowDetection: Enable/disable mog shadow detection for MOG
learningRate: Learning rate for the MOG

Multipartite graph tracker parameters:
start_frame: Frame to start the segmentation and tracking
stop_frame: Frame to stop the segmentation and tracking
graph_window: Size of the window for the multipartite graph / number of graphs
position_weight: Position weight for the characteristic relation between nodes
histogram_weight: Color information weight for the characteristic relation between nodes
contour_weight: Contour weight for the characteristic relation between nodes
init_tkp_threshold: Number of pixels as error to consider for the initialization points to assign the labels for blobs
area_weight: Area weight for the characteristic relation between nodes
speed_weight: Speed weight for the characteristic relation between nodes
direction_weight: Direction weight for the characteristic relation between nodes
max_speed: Threshold value for the difference on distance between blobs to be considered as a relation
max_merge_distance: used on old oclusion solver versions
min_blob_area_threshold: Blobs below this percent of the average blob area within a MPG are not considered on the oclusion solver
merged_blob_area_threshold: Blobs above this percent of the average blob area within a MPG are considered as merged blobs
enable_oclusion_solver: Select and enable the oclusion solver for the mpgt
enable_abduction_finder: Enable the abduction solver for the mpgt, if disable abductions are recovered using the incidence multiparite matrix
blob_memoir_lenght: How many frames a blob should be remembered if is part of a merge event
memoir_diff_threshold: Not used
enable_clustering: Enable different clustering algorithms for blob classification
hue_clustering_only: Use only hue channel for clusters, otherwise use hue and saturation
how_many_colors: How many predominant colors are used as features for clustering
area_as_cluster_feature: Use the normalized blob area as a clustering feature
clustering_mode: Clustering algorithm. 1:k-means 2:k-means++ 3:AHC with single linkage 4: AHC with complete linkage 5: AHC with Ward
n_clusters: Number of clusters
match_method: Template match method used on the oclusion splitter, see opencv docs for values.
match_threshold: Threshold value to considered as a good template match (depends on the match method)

Drawing settings:
enable_boundary_blob_remover: Dont draw blobs outside the lower and upper boundaries
lower_boundary: Lower boundart defined as a percent of the height of the frame. Equal to the bottom of the video.
