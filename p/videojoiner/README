-=General instructions=-
This tool is mainly for videos from the 4K cameras. 
OpenCV only supports the avi container for video output.


-=Tipical use=-
1. Get the timecodes from the *.mxf files (using the script timecode_generator.sh)
and copy them to the configuration file. If timecode is not available or the cameras werent syncronized with the timecodes is
better to choose the manual or graphic syncronization modes.

2. Convert *.mxf files to *.mp4 using the mfx2mp4.sh script.

3. Configure the joiner editing the configuration file options.

4. First enable the point selection mode 1 to choose the corners and middle points of the field on each side, this is done just once.
   Is also a good idea to use point selection mode 2 to select the cropping point to cut the output images and fit them on the video, this is done just once.

5. Run

-=Other notes=-
Cropping the video is a good idea because of the max dimensions that the video codecs can handle.
