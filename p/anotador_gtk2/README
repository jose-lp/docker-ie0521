-=Requirements=-

The cluster development environment with modules for cuda-8 or cuda-7.5, gcc-4.9.2, opencv-2.4.13, yaml-cpp 0.6 and ffmpeg 4.1. If not possible, run
the install.sh script and modify the macros values detected by opencv for the keyboard on the config.yaml file.

-=General instructions=-

 Arguments: 
-i <ifile>:     Input video file
-l:              Load tracking file data.
-c <cfile>:    Configuration file.
-t <tfile>:     Tracking file to store or load tracking information with YAML format.
-r: <size>:		Resize anotations keeping the ratio.
-o: <ofile>:	Output file if resize option is selected.
--help:              Show help

Example execution:

./AnotadorRastreo -c ./config.yaml -t ./trackings/jam-crc.yaml -i /tmp/game.avi
./AnotadorRastreo -c ./config.yaml -t ./trackings/jam-crc.yaml -i /tmp/game.avi -l
Keyboard Controls: 
right arrow to forward 1 frame.
left arrow to backward 1 frame.
up arrow to forward a step of frames.
down arrow to backward a step of frames.
+ to increase step size.
- to decrease step size.
c to increase step size in 1 second.
z to decrease step size in 1 second.
d to delete labels on a frame.
b to delete last label on a frame.
a to add a label.
s to save all trackings to file.
w to show current frame number. 
q to quit program

Mouse Controls:
The actions of the buttons depends if the gtk GUI is enable through the config file
Left button: Mark a position to tag
Middle button: Non
Right button: Non
Ctrl+Left button: If gtk GUI enable, move backwards 1 frame
Ctrl+Middle button: If gtk GUI enable, tag last marked position with a popup window
Ctrl+Right button: If gtk GUI enalbe, move foward 1 frame

-=Tipical use=-
Select the center of a player with a left mouse click, then press 'a' key (or Ctrl+Middle botton) and add a label for the player at the terminal or GUI window, repeat for each player on each
frame, at the end save tracking information with 's' key.  In case of an error during the manual anotation, use d to delete the labels for the current frame or b to delete the last anotation. A resize operation is included passing the load and resize options as arguments to the program, the size is the lenght of the video, this program keeps the aspect ratio.

-=Configuration file=-
At the configuration file is possible to change the key binding (useful if doesnt work the keys, could happen if the opencv library is different) and some general functional
options such as the number of frames for each step.

-=Other notes=-
If the load option is selected, the file with the data must be provide with the -t (tracking) option at the command line.
